## **Step 2: Configure Database**

1. **Start XAMPP/WAMP** and open **phpMyAdmin** by visiting:  
   `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`
2. **Create a new database** named `event_management`.
3. **Import the SQL file:**
    - Go to **phpMyAdmin** â†’ Click on `event_management` database.
    - Click the **Import** tab.
    - Select the file located at `root/database.sql`.
    - Click **Go** to import the database.

## **Step 3: Configure Database Connection**

1. Open the project folder and navigate to `config/Database.php`.
2. Update the database credentials:

```php
class Database {
    private static $instance = null;
    private $pdo;

    private function __construct() {
        $this->pdo = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=event_management", "root", "");
    }

    public static function getInstance() {
        if (self::$instance == null) {
            self::$instance = new Database();
        }
        return self::$instance;
    }

    public function getConnection() {
        return $this->pdo;
    }
}
```

If your MySQL has a password, update the `"root", ""` section with your credentials.

- Verify that the `event_management` database exists in **phpMyAdmin**.

### **2. "404 Not Found" Issues**
